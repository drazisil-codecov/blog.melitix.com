Welcome to the brand new Melitix Blog! - a blog focused on meetups and the communities they facilitate.
Whether you are a solo meetup organizer, a business holding events, or you just attend meetups, I'm aiming to have content for you.


## The Melitix Blog

This blog will be a source of content teaching meetup organizers the how and why of creating meetups.
The physical act of creating a meetup isn't hard but not everyone understands the work that goes into actually running a successful meetup.
The Melitix Blog will do its best in helping to spread that message and provide you with the right resources to succeed.

## What is Melitix?

Melitix is a Meetup.com competitor I am building.
While it's designed to be an improvement in every way, the two main differentiators will be in pricing and technology.
You can learn more and sign up to be notified on when Melitix is ready [here](https://melitix.com/).


## Who I am?

My name is Ricardo N Feliciano though you'll frequently see me as FelicianoTech across the web.
I've been a Developer Advocate for about 5 years and been engaging with programmers in general for 10 years now.
I've given talks in stage, organized meetups and hackathons, and attended many events all over the United States.

I've learned first hand how powerful meetups can be yet how lacking the industry is when it comes to resources on meetups.
My goal is for the Melitix Blog and eventually Melitix itself to fill that gap.
